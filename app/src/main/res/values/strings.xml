    <string name="rules_text_view">This game is called Thirty and is played by throwing 6 dice for a total of 10 rounds.
        For each round, the dice can be thrown a maximum of 3 times.
        Dice can then be chosen to be held, which will store the die\'s value and disable the die for the rest of the round.
        When the round is over, a scoring mode is chosen. This scoring mode is either "Low",
        which means the sum of all values below or equal to 3, or it\'s a numeric value.
        For numeric values the score is calculated by finding the combination of dice
        that are equal to the numeric value (target score) and that together yield the largest sum,
        only allowing each die to be counted once. A dice setup of 1, 1, 1, 2, 4 and 4 with a
        target score of 5 yields 10 points, combining 4 - 1 and 4 - 1.
        When 10 rounds have been played and the scoring choices have been exhausted, the results will be presented.
        Good luck!
